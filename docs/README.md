# Engineering Practices

Welcome to the Engineering Practices Documentation! These documents are a collection of various best practices that most of the big tech
companies, such as Google and Microsoft, use in their day-to-day development process. It also has some of my personal experience and
preference over the years working with C#.

These are the main sections in the wiki that you can always access from the sidebar to the right:

- [C# Coding guidelines](Coding.md)
- [Engineering guidelines](Engineering.md)
- [Testing](Testing.md)
