This project is an attempt to recreate the CQRS Journey by Microsoft with more modern technologies and patterns. Not just compilation but also new recommended code in EF Core, ASP.NET Core, and other new related versions with several significant changes. 

This repository contains all code + deployment scripts for the solution.
